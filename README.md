## BDD
Below is the behavior expected from this app:

The player whose turn it is throws the dice and they get points matching that on the top-side. For example 5.

The players accumulates points until the top-side face shows one, then they lose all points accumulated in that round and its the other player's turn.

If the player clicks the hold button before they get a 1 in the topside, its the other player's turn however they get all the points accumulated so far. For example if they have thrown 3, 4, 5 and 6, they will get 18 points added to the points they had before.

If a player throws the dice and they get a 1, they get a zero and it is automatically the other player's turn.
